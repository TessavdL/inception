# CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

# nginx daemon off runs nginx in the foreground

# the default nginx daemon on will start nginx in the background
# this way nginx and other services are running and talking to each other
# one server runs many services

# with docker one container has only once service

# the initial process spawns a master nginx process and some workers and then immediately quits
# docker only watches the pid of the original command and therefore the container halts

# by turning off the daemon we keep the container running

# docker system prune -a
# cleans up any unused resources (images, volumes, containers) and networks

# docker ps
# shows all running containers

# docker images
# shows all images

# docker build -t "name_of_image" .

# docker run -it --name "name" -p 80:80 "name_of_image" bash
# will run the container in interactive mode so you can interact with it

# while the container is running you can use
# docker cp "name_of_container":"path_from_root_of_container" "path_host"
# to copy

# -rm removes container after it's done running

# to check if TSL 1.3 is enabled
# openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -tls1_3
